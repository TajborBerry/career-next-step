# 🧠 Introvert Classification (Planned)

## 📌 Overview

This project will explore the use of machine learning to classify individuals as **introverts or extroverts** based on behavioral, demographic, and psychological traits. The goal is to understand what factors may influence social tendencies and how well they can be predicted using modern classification techniques.

This will be part of a broader effort to **build interpretable models** that link personality-related features to observable patterns — with potential applications in personalization, recommendation engines, or mental well-being tools.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build an interpretable model that classifies introversion/extroversion
- Explore feature importance using SHAP or LIME
- Evaluate fairness and bias in predictions
- Visualize latent structures using dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE or UMAP)

## 🔍 Planned Steps

1. **Data Exploration**  
   - Source data from surveys or psychological datasets  
   - Clean and preprocess features

2. **Model Building**  
   - Try multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
   - Focus on interpretability and recall

3. **Dimensionality Analysis**  
   - Use t-SNE or UMAP to visualize high-dimensional patterns in social traits

4. **Explainability**  
   - Apply SHAP values to understand model reasoning  
   - Highlight potential ethical considerations

5. **Write-Up**  
   - Interpret findings and relate them to known psychological research  
   - Add visual storytelling components

## 📦 Tools & Libraries

- `scikit-learn`  
- `xgboost`  
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
- `shap`, `umap-learn`, `tsne`  
- `jupyterlab` or `notebooks`

## 📅 Timeline

**Expected start**: August 2025  
**Duration**: ~2–3 weeks of active work alongside other projects  
**Deliverables**: Notebook, README, and blog-style summary
