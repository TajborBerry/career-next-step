## 📌 Repo Purpose

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and roadmap as I transition into more advanced data science roles. The goal is to show strong technical foundations paired with clear business thinking and communication.

It will include:
- Clean, reproducible Jupyter notebooks
- Versioned experiments and comparison logs
- Visualizations and explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME)
- Notes and summaries like blog posts for each project
- Clear business framing of every problem

## ⏳ Updated Timeline

- **June–July 2025:** Complete first project (Customer Churn) and wrap up foundational ML refresh  
- **August–September 2025:** Build second core project (AB testing or forecasting)  
- **October 2025:** Polish portfolio, write-ups, and final dashboard  
- **November–December 2025:** Job search, applications, and networking
